Hey there, here is some site information:

* Maintained by: Me

## Site breakdown

### Home

This is the landing page.

### About

Contains a few facts about me and links to LinkedIn and GitHub.

### Gallery

Contains a thumbnail gallery of projects I've worked on (note: these will eventually be replaced with actual projects I've worked on and all thumbnails will link to an information page about them).

### Contact

Has a form where people can contact me, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub.

## Site maintenance

### HTML

All pages are separated into separate HTML files. Page structure is largely defined by the bootsrap column layout.
THE MENU BAR IS STICKY! This is for the bonus in the homework.

### CSS

One custom stylesheet is referenced only. All other stylesheets and scripts are Bootstrap and FontAwesome. 
There is only one custom Media Query used - for mobile phones. Other device sizes are covered under the column layout.
